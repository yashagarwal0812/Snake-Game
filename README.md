# Snake Game in Python

This is a simple Snake Game project implemented in Python using the Turtle module and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The game features collision with walls, collision with the snake's tail, and scoring as the snake eats food and grows longer.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Turtle module (usually comes with Python installation)

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `snake_game.py` script using Python:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```
The game window will appear, and you can now start playing.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
- Guide the snake to eat the food (represented by a green dot) to increase the score and grow longer.
- The game will end if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.

## Project Structure
The project follows a simple structure:

1. **main.py**: The main Python script that contains the game's logic, including the Snake and Food classes.
2. **README.md**: The file you are currently reading, providing information about the project and how to run it.

## OOP Concepts
The Snake Game project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through the implementation of classes:

- **Snake**: Represents the snake in the game. It has attributes like **head**, **segments**, **direction**, and methods like **move**, **grow**, **collide_with_walls**, **collide_with_tail**, etc.
- **Food**: Represents the food that the snake needs to eat. It has attributes like **position**.
- **Game**: This class manages the game's state, including updating the snake and food positions, handling collisions, and managing the game loop.

## Additional Notes
- The project uses the Turtle module for simple graphics and easy handling of movements on the screen.
- You can modify the game settings, such as the grid size, snake speed, or food appearance, by tweaking the constants defined in the snake_game.py script.
- Feel free to explore and enhance the project as you like!

## Credits
This Snake Game project is inspired by various online tutorials and resources on Python game development. Special thanks to the Turtle module developers and the Python community for providing valuable resources and support.
